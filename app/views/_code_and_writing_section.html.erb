        <h1>WRITING</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="memory">One bright fall morning many years ago, I finished reading Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i>. I was exhilarated. The novel had moved me and I remember thinking, "I want to try that too ... I want to write a book that is adventurous, profound, and full of pathos all at once." Years later, I set out to do that. What I ended up with were a slew of characters I loved. And these, the three books in the "Max Mayhem Series". They are urban fantasy stories set in Portland, OR. Max is 12-years-old in <i>Lune</i>, the prequel. By the end of <i>The Oddclock</i> he is 16, battle-worn, and madly in love with his best friend, Lydia.</p>


        <!-- <p class="memory">It is a bright fall morning. The air is crisp; the leaves, red. I am downtown, breath fogging as I walk. I have just finished reading Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> for a political philosophy class and I am exhilirated, thrilled. The story has moved me and I think to myself, how awesome would it be? To write something like that, something that moves people? And something clicks. A few years later, I write a manuscript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is godawful.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="memory">But I revise it, try again. I write another one, and another. My friends go to graduate school, get real jobs. For me, a slew of characters evolve. I come to love them. Writing becomes purpose. Many years pass, at the end of which I have three books called "The Max Mayhem Series."</p>
        <br>
        <p>One day I will return to them. For now, though, programming is enough.</p> -->
