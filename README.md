This is my personal website. I am building it with Ruby, Rails, and Javascript, using Bulma for the CSS framework, and incorporating a variety of Ruby Gems for everything from authentication to admin functionality. Generally speaking, I'm aiming for a simple, dark-themed UI with splashes of blue-green color, and a smooth, intuitive UX. Eventually, this site will have five different sections. They are as follows.

1. ABOUT
  * A paragraph or two about me
  * A section listing my skills
  * A section listing hobbies
  * A list of books and films I enjoy

2. PLAIN ENGLISH
  * Perhaps my favorite part of this site, Plain English will explain computer terminology in simple terms
  * I'm going to pretend my readers are a class of eighth graders who have used computers but otherwise know nothing about code or computer science  
  * I'm going to utilize a pSQL Database for this. Each term will be an instance of  `class Term`  

3. PORTFOLIO
  * Single page section with pictures of and links to my other coding projects

4. CODE
  * To start, this section will have 10 'toy' programming problems
  * 5 of them will be written in Ruby
  * 5 of them will be written in Javascript
  * For example, there may be a Javascript 'Ping-Pong' problem. First, the idea will be explained. I.e. "Please input a positive number. The Javascript is going to return an array of numbers from 1 to the number you input. All numbers divisible by 3 will be replaced with "ping". All numbers divisible by 5 will be replaced with "pong". So, if you give me the number 7, the program will return 1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7.  
  * Each problem will have a link titled 'show me the code', which will invoke a modal window displaying the actual coding logic.
  * I'm going to use the Red Carpet gem to stylize the code in the modals    

5. WRITING
  * An introduction to my history as a writer
  * An overview of the Max Mayhem Services
  * A link to my novel, BLOODWOOD
  * The firts 10 chapters of my unpublished novel, THE ODDCLOCK  

 (1) ABOUT (2) CODE, which will have many different pages. A Javascript page with copious built-in examples of Javascript code. E.g. a ping-pong calculater, a dice game, etc. An API page that uses one or several APIs. Perhaps a Ruby page. A page or two dedicated to Firebase NoSQL objects and CRUD functionality. And so on and so forth. (3) WRITING. This will give a brief overview of my writing background and display excerpts from my books, BLOODWOOD and THE ODDCLOCK. (4) PLAIN ENGLISH. In this section I would like to explain computer science concepts in plain English. It will have only one or two entries at first. An entry, say, for the DOM, where the DOM is explained without using computer terminology. Or perhaps an entry about nodes. Or the difference between URLs, IP addresses, domain names, websites, and servers.
